👋 Hi, I'm Daryna

Junior QA Engineer in training | Manual Testing | Web | API | SQL

I’m transitioning into QA after several years of hands-on digital work, bringing a strong sense of structure, visual clarity, and analytical thinking.
Currently completing my QA program at Mate Academy and building practical projects that reflect real testing workflows: functional checks, regression cycles, exploratory testing, API requests, and clean, readable documentation.

I love well-organized systems, thoughtful UX, and that oddly satisfying moment when a bug finally shows itself in all its chaotic glory.

🚀 What I’m Working On

A full Manual Web Testing project with test cases, bug reports, and a test summary

Practicing API testing with Postman

Creating SQL validation queries

Writing exploratory testing reports

Improving my Git workflow and QA documentation style
