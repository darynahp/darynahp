### 💻 About Me
I build structured testing environments for web and API products. My approach focuses on finding the "why" behind a bug and ensuring that software doesn't just work, but stays resilient through updates. 

I’ve spent the last year at **Mate Academy** refining my workflow—moving from exploratory manual testing to building automated suites that streamline the delivery process. I value logic-driven bug reporting and clean, maintainable documentation.
