### 💻 About Me
I’m a QA Engineer focused on exploring software from every angle to ensure a seamless user experience. I focus on end-to-end web testing, API validation, and building automated scripts that actually save time.

After completing the intensive QA program at **Mate Academy**, I’ve been focusing on the logic behind the bugs—not just finding them, but documenting them clearly to bridge the gap between testing and development. Currently, I'm deep-diving into **Playwright** for UI automation and **Postman** for API testing.
